# Systems: Character Creation

In [Modes](Modes.md), you create a different Sheet for each Mode you're using: a [Narrative Sheet](Sheets.Narrative.md) if you're using [Narrative Mode](Mode.Narrative.md), and a [Battle Sheet](Sheets.Battle.md) if you're using [Battle Mode](Mode.Battle.md). You may also need to make a [Source Sheet](Sheets.Source.md) if you plan to use more advanced combat rules.

If you're not using a particular mode, then don't bother with that sheet. If you're using a different game system for what that mode covers, then use that systems rules. Alternately, you might choose to *Fiat* a Mode. Check [here](z.Optional.Fiat.md) for more details on that.

One thing that all sheets share, however, is [Trauma](Systems.Trauma.md);

## Narrative Character

The Narrative Character Sheet is a combination of short biography (Background) and a Curriculum Vitae (Traits) - it states who your character is, where they came from, what skills they've picked up, and any affiliations they have. This is roughly divided into Background and Traits.
