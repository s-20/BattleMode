# Systems: Source

Source is short for "Power Source" and it's where a character's special abilities come from. The Source Sheet is used to track a Source which in turn helps build Techniques, Manuevers, and Powers for a Battle Sheet. It also helps in Narrative Mode and can be used to justify some actions in that mode as well.
