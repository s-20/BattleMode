# BattleMode

Battle Mode is a TTRPG/Tabletop Combat System with RPG elements inspired by Dead Cells and other Roguelites. It also owes a debt to both the carefully constructed tactical combat rules of the fourth edition of The World's Most Popular Role Playing Game and the Narrative Focus of more modern role playing game design.

BattleMode is intended as a mechanical framework to hang other things on. It provides no setting details or other
