# BattleMode

Battle Mode is a TTRPG/Tabletop Combat System with RPG elements inspired by Dead Cells and other Roguelites

## The Basics

Characters are made up of three general categories of characteristic:

- **Attributes**, which represent the character's basic combative abilities
- **Containers**, which are things that hold special modifiers that let them do cool stuff in combat; these are things like weapons, magic, and so on
- **Deets**, or Details, which represent non-combative things that the character knows about or how to do.

Attributes provide dice to roll, containers give you stuff you can do in a fight, and Deets give you options out of combat - that's about it.

### [Attributes](BAttributes.md)

There are 4 Attributes:

- **Close Combat *(CC)***: Your ability in melee range, or within 4 meters/yards (2 squares) of your position. This means hitting stuff and hurting stuff, but it also means blocking with shields or parrying with weapons (or whatever).
- **Distant Combat *(DC)***: Your ability in combat beyond melee range, further away than 4 meters (2 squares). This means hitting stuff with things your fire or yeet, but it also means getting out of the way of things fired or yeeted at you.
- **Vigor *(VI)***: Physical toughness, resistance to injury, poison, sickness, and such.
- **Talent *(TA)***: Your ability to use stuff that isn't weapons under pressure - this includes Skills, Tools, Traps, and other Containers.

In addition to the four Attributes, there are ## Stats:

- **Hit Points *(HP)***: How much punishment you can take. Starts at 2x Vigor + all other Attributes combined
- **Damage Resistance *(DR)***: How much damage you ignore from *all* incoming attacks, except AP attacks. Determined by armor
- **Avoidance *(AV)***: How well you get out of the way of area attacks; CC+DC divided by 2
- **Recovery *(REC)***: How quickly you recover expendable Container abilities. Starts equal to Talent x2 + all other Attributes combined

See [Attributes](BAttributes.md) for more information.

### [Containers](BContainers.md)

Containers are groups of abilities granted by powers, special training, abilities, weapons, tools, and so on. Most Containers have more than one thing in them - a Dagger might have a Throw, Stab, and Slash that each do something slightly different, for instance.

Containers come in many forms - from Spell Paths to Martial Arts Katas to Weapons or Traps. They're made up of a Base and Addons - the Base determines the primary function, and the Addons ad variations on that theme.

See [Containers](BContainers.md) for more information

### [Deets](BDeets.md)

Deets, or Details, are a few statements describing your character, what they're good at, and the kinds of thing they know. Dees give you a bonus in out-of-combat resolution.

See [Deets](BDeets.md) for more... errr, details.

## [Dice](BDice.md)

BattleMode uses d10 dice exclusively. If you see 5d, that means five ten sided dice. The 0 on the d10 is always read as a 10. See [Dice](BDice.md) for more information.

### Ties and Rounding

Ties go in favor of the player; in PVP, highest Attribute wins the tie; if it's still a tie, both fail. Rounding is always up.
