# BattleMode

[Battle Mode](https://s-20.github.io/BattleMode/) is a TTRPG/Tabletop Combat System with RPG elements inspired by Dead Cells and other Roguelites. It also owes a debt to both the carefully constructed tactical combat rules of the fourth edition of The World's Most Popular Role Playing Game and the Narrative Focus of more modern role playing game design.

[BattleMode](https://s-20.github.io/BattleMode/) is intended as a mechanical framework to hang other things on. It provides no setting details or other specifics, and should customized as needed for each individual campaign.

## Purpose

Honestly? I have had issues recently with ideas that don't fit in with my [unnamed TTRPG project](https://s-20.github.io/unnamed/#/) but _do_ more or less fit together plaguing me wile I'm writing. So I decided to give those ideas a home to get them out of my head. Eventually, they started to coalesce into something resembling a full system in my mind and notes. That system is [BattleMode](https://s-20.github.io/BattleMode/).

In a less behind-the-curtain way, though, the purpose of [BattleMode](https://s-20.github.io/BattleMode/) is to provide a system that divorces combat crunch from the more narrative part of a game, allowing you to have the narrative-driven goodness for most of the game, backed up by a solid combat system that is (in my opinion) lacking in narrative driven games.

Because the combat system (the eponymous Battle Mode) and the Narrative System are separate things connected loosely together by a few hooks, if I do this right, you should be able to slide the Battle Mode part into your favorite other system. That's the idea, anyway.

## unnamed

My main TTRPG project goes under the working title of [unnamed](https://s-20.github.io/unnamed/#/). If you'd like to follow it's development, the GitHub page is [here](https://github.com/s-20/unnamed), and the Wiki itself is [right here](https://s-20.github.io/unnamed/#/).

unnamed shares some traits with [BattleMode](https://s-20.github.io/BattleMode/), but is a very different animal.
