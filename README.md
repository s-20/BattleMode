# Modes

**[Modes](https://s-20.github.io/Modes/)** is a TTRPG System inspired by problems I have with the union of combat and narrative systems in modern (and old school) game systems. It owes a debt to both the tactical combat rules of the fourth edition of The World's Most Popular Role Playing Game and the Narrative Focus of more modern role playing game design.

**Modes** is a general purpose system intended for games where you want interesting, permissive narrative game-play without sacrificing the fun crunch of tactical combat scenarios. The intention is for it to be hackable into any story where both of these is a priority, from low fantasy to four-color superheroics.

## Purpose

The purpose of **Modes** is to provide a system that divorces combat crunch from the more narrative part of a game, allowing you to have the narrative-driven goodness that can be missing from more tactically oriented games, while also having the fun crunchy tactical combat missing from games with a more narrative bent.

Because the systems are distinct (without being all that different from each other), you should be able to replace the way any given game handles *either* narrative play *or* combat with the different *modes*. So if you want the narrative paradigm of, say, [Gumshoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumshoe_System), but feel it's combat is lacking, just use [Battle Mode](Mode.Battle.md) when you get into a fight.

Another idea for the **Modes** system is expandability. Different *Modes* can be made and slotted in to handle additional custom systems of play. For example, if you want to add in some sort of base management system to the game, you create a new Mode for that. If you want some sort of court intrigue mechanic that's separate from the way general narrative is handled, make a mode and add that.

## Getting Started

**Modes** is in active development and is in a "pre-alpha" state. If you're interested in seeing what's going on or using what little is here, start with [Modes](Modes.md).

If you have feedback or want to contribute, feel free to follow the project on GitHub (or wherever I decide to host it), make pull requests, report "bugs", or whatever. The project home page is [Here](https://github.com/s-20/Modes).
