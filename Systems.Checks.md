## Check Results

### Check Result Table

| Dice Total vs DIF | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 3 (regardless of DIFF) | [Major Failure](Systems.MajorSF.md) |
| 4 to `DIFF-5` | Marginal Failure; *Fail Forward* |
| `DIFF-4` to `DIFF-1` | Marginal Success; *Success at a Cost/With a Twist* |
| `DIFF` to `DIFF+4` | Success; the higher the total result, the better. |
| `DIFF+5` or greater | [Major Success](Systems.MajorSF.md); the higher the total result, the better. |
