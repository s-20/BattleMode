# Systems: Bonuses and Penalties

Basically, bonuses and penalties come in the form or Bonus Dice and Penalty Dice, which are dice added to a check. They cancel each other out one for one. If you have more Penalty dice than Bonus dice, you count the lowest three dice results on your check, and if your total Bonus dice are higher, you count the highest dice. That's it, really.

## Bonus Dice

## Penalty Dice

## Flat Bonuses and Penalties

+2 or -2; no more than 2 flat bonuses/penalties can be applied to  a single check.
