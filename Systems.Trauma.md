# Systems: Trauma

Trauma represents severe or debilitating damage a character has taken, whether in or out of combat. It is meant to represent physical, psychological, and emotional harm, and is a combination "wound" and "condition" systems.

Each Trauma entry has its own effect based on the damage the character has taken. For example, you might have "Injured Leg: -2 Movement", or "Nauseated: roll 1d4 when making a check; on a 1, take -2 to your total."

Characters can only take so much Trauma before everything starts getting hard for them (called *Spiraling*), and after a certain point may be unable to act effectively at all (*Out of Action*).

## Taking Trauma

Characters can acquire trauma in different ways:

* **Severe Damage: Combat**: Every time your take more than 10 [Hit Points](Systems.HitPoints.md) of damage in a single hit, you receive Trauma. For every 20 Hit Points of damage you take total, you also take Trauma.
* **Major Failure: Combat**: If you roll a [Major Failure](Systems.MajorSF.md) when defending against an attack in [Battle Mode](Mode.Battle.md), you take Trauma appropriate to the attack
* **Major Failure: Narrative**: If you are doing something dangerous in [Narrative Mode](Mode.Narrative.md) and roll a Major Failure, you might take Trauma appropriate to what you were doing.
* **Narrative Events**: During a story, bad things happen, and these sometimes result in Trauma regardless of your checks or other actions; these events can result in Trauma.
