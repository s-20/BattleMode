## Art

All contributed art is either taken from a permissive licensed source and credited here, or was either commissioned or freely contributed to the Modes project.

Commissioned and contributed art is the property of its original creator, presented in Modes under an agreement between the artist and the Modes project. If you wish to use the art elsewhere, you need to contact the original creator. Outside of public domain or other permissively licensed or copyleft sources, this is generally ethical practice anyway, so do that.
